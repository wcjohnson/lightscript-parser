# @lightscript/parser

## If you are looking to get started with the LightScript language, this is the wrong place -- [check out the docs here!](http://wcjohnson.github.io/lightscript)

@oigroup/lightscript is a futuristic fork of the [LightScript](http://lightscript.org) language with additional features, fixes, and tools. This is the parser for [@oigroup/LightScript](http://wcjohnson.github.io/lightscript).
To be used with [@oigroup/babel-plugin-lightscript](https://github.com/wcjohnson/babel-plugin-lightscript).

Unless you are working on tooling or hacking the language itself, you don't need this -- get the [Babel preset](http://wcjohnson.github.io/lightscript) instead.

A fork of [@babel/parser](https://github.com/babel/babel).
